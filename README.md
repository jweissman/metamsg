## Metamsg

Metamessenger is intended to be a command-line interface to social webservices, providing
a unified CLI for power and an extensible API so you can connect up to your own services.

Other ideas: a little daemon driving a webpage like mailcatcher for a river of news effect and
a visual interface to the metamsg API, Growl integration, and perhaps a related webservice.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'metamsg'
